# Supervised Machine Learning

This repository contains Python implementations of supervised machine learning algorithms as part of my academic coursework.  
All models are implemented using standard machine learning libraries and are organized topic-wise.

The repository will be continuously updated as new algorithms are covered in the syllabus.
